# JobSift

JobSift is a React Native mobile application built to showcase my mobile development skills and my ability to work with APIs. The app helps users discover and apply for jobs using the [JSearch API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch) from RapidAPI. It features a modern, intuitive interface for browsing popular and nearby jobs, searching by keyword or type, and viewing detailed job information.

## Features

- 🔍 **Search Jobs:** Find jobs by keyword or job type (Full-time, Part-time, Contractor).
- 🏆 **Popular & Nearby Jobs:** Browse curated lists of popular and nearby job postings.
- 📄 **Job Details:** View comprehensive job descriptions, qualifications, and responsibilities.
- ❤️ **Save Jobs:** Like jobs for quick access (UI only).
- 📱 **Responsive UI:** Clean, mobile-first design with custom fonts and icons.
- 🌐 **Pagination:** Easily navigate through multiple pages of search results.
